# DessertList

iOS application with a simple UI that utilizes data pulled via API provided at https://themealdb.com/api.php.

Specifically, it is retrieving a list of dessert meals from https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert and additional details for each dessert from https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID. 

Application builds successfully with xCode 14.2.0. The Mac Mini I have does not support a later version. 

At the top of each file there are comments I added providing more detail as to why that file exists.
